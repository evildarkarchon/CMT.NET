# SelectedItems Implementation in CMT.NET Archive Patcher

## Problem Background
The original challenge was that Avalonia's DataGrid doesn't have a direct `SelectedItems` binding property like WPF. This made it difficult to implement multi-selection functionality for the Archive Patcher.

## How the Selection was Simplified

### Original Problem
- Avalonia DataGrid lacks `SelectedItems` binding
- Direct manipulation of DataGrid selection from ViewModel was problematic
- DataGrid `Name` property was causing accessibility issues

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. **Model Enhancement**
```csharp
public class ArchiveInfo : ReactiveObject
{
    // ... existing properties ...
    
    [Reactive] public bool IsSelected { get; set; }
}
```

#### 2. **CheckBox Column in DataGrid**
```xaml
<DataGridCheckBoxColumn Header="Select" Width="60">
    <DataGridCheckBoxColumn.Binding>
        <Binding Path="IsSelected" />
    </DataGridCheckBoxColumn.Binding>
</DataGridCheckBoxColumn>
```

#### 3. **ViewModel Selection Management**
```csharp
public class ArchivePatcherViewModel : ViewModelBase
{
    [Reactive] public ObservableCollection<ArchiveInfo> SelectedArchives { get; set; } = new();
    
    private void UpdateSelectedArchives()
    {
        SelectedArchives.Clear();
        foreach (var archive in FilteredArchives.Where(a => a.IsSelected))
        {
            SelectedArchives.Add(archive);
        }
    }
}
```

#### 4. **Real-time Updates**
```csharp
// In RefreshAsync method
archive.WhenAnyValue(x => x.IsSelected)
    .Subscribe(_ => UpdateSelectedArchives());
```

## Current Functionality Status

### ✅ **Fully Functional Features**

1. **Individual Selection**
   - Users can click checkboxes to select/deselect individual archives
   - Real-time updates to `SelectedArchives` collection

2. **Select All/None Commands**
   - "Select All" button selects all visible (filtered) archives
   - "Select None" button deselects all archives
   - Both update the UI immediately

3. **Filter Integration**
   - Selection state is preserved when filters are applied
   - Only visible archives are affected by Select All/None

4. **Command Binding**
   - `PatchSelectedCommand` is enabled/disabled based on selection
   - Commands can access the `SelectedArchives` collection

### ✅ **How It Works**

1. **User Interaction**
   - User clicks checkbox in DataGrid
   - `IsSelected` property on `ArchiveInfo` is updated
   - ReactiveUI triggers property change notification

2. **Automatic Updates**
   - Property change subscription fires
   - `UpdateSelectedArchives()` method is called
   - `SelectedArchives` collection is updated
   - UI commands are re-evaluated

3. **Command Execution**
   - Commands use `SelectedArchives` collection
   - Only checked archives are processed

## Benefits of This Approach

### **Advantages**
1. **Avalonia-Native**: Works with Avalonia's binding system
2. **Real-time**: Updates happen immediately on user interaction
3. **Clean Separation**: ViewModel doesn't need DataGrid references
4. **Testable**: Selection logic can be unit tested
5. **Maintainable**: Clear, declarative code

### **Performance**
- Minimal overhead for small to medium archive collections
- Efficient updates using ReactiveUI subscriptions
- No polling or manual UI updates required

## Technical Implementation Details

### **Key Components**

1. **ArchiveInfo.IsSelected**: Individual selection state
2. **ViewModel.SelectedArchives**: Collection of selected items
3. **UpdateSelectedArchives()**: Synchronization method
4. **Property Subscriptions**: Real-time update mechanism
5. **DataGridCheckBoxColumn**: UI representation

### **Flow Diagram**
```
User clicks checkbox → IsSelected property changes → 
ReactiveUI notification → UpdateSelectedArchives() → 
SelectedArchives collection updated → Commands re-evaluated
```

## Testing Status

The implementation has been:
- ✅ **Compiled successfully** (no build errors)
- ✅ **Integrated** with existing Archive Patcher workflow
- ✅ **Tested** with ReactiveUI property bindings
- ✅ **Validated** with command enabling/disabling logic

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. **Bulk Selection**: Shift+click for range selection
2. **Selection Persistence**: Remember selections across sessions
3. **Smart Selection**: Select based on criteria (version, size, etc.)
4. **Selection Statistics**: Show count of selected items

## Conclusion

The `SelectedItems` functionality is now **fully functional** and provides a clean, Avalonia-native solution for multi-selection in the Archive Patcher. The implementation successfully avoids the common pitfalls of DataGrid selection in Avalonia while maintaining good performance and user experience.
